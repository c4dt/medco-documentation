Generalities
++++++++++++

We have a development and a stable version. The `master`-branch in `github.com/ldsec/medco-unlynx` always points to the
latest stable version. The `dev`-branch
is the development version that works but can have incompatible changes.

Use the latest that are stable and have no incompatible changes.
