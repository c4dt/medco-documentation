A cohort selection user interface for [TranSMART].


## Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 1.0.0.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma], run `ng test --code-coverage` to test with generated coverage documents, which are located in the coverage folder.

### Running end-to-end tests

For e2e test we use [Cypress] in combination with the [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor].
[Cypress] is install as part of the your `npm install` command.
To run the tests using the headless browser `npm run e2e` or `npm run cypress` to launch the GUI.
by default the tests expect a glowing bear instance to be running at http://localhost:4200/. This can be changed in cypress.json
WARNING: tests alter state. All saved queries are deleted.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Publishing

We use Gradle to create bundles that are suitable for deployment:
```bash
# Create a tar bundle in build/distributions
gradle assemble

# Publish the bundle to Nexus
gradle publish
```

## Deployment

Published snapshot bundles are available in the `snapshots` repository
on https://repo.thehyve.nl with id `nl.thehyve:glowing-bear:0.0.1-SNAPSNOT:tar`.

Untar the archive in a directory where it can be served by a web server,
e.g., [Apache] or [nginx].
